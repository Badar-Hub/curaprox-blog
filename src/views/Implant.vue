            <li>
              Feel secure you’re doing everything you can to care for your

          <p>
            Care for your dental implants – and help prevent further implants –
            by committing to a great oral health routine…
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brush your teeth twice a day</li>
            <li>Use interdental brushes once a day</li>

          <h3>Use interdental brushes to clean your dental implants…</h3>
          <p>
            Failure to brush in the interdental spaces - the spaces between
            teeth - is a major health risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            And cleaning with interdental brushes is significantly more
            effective than flossing, according to a recent
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99431/"
              >meta-analysis</a

          <ul>
            <li>
              After implant treatment, the spaces around your “new tooth” can be
              much larger than usual.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fine, long bristles of the&nbsp;<a

              >
              gently clean those spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              As with all CURAPROX interdental brushes,
              <a href="https://curaprox.ch/en/blog"
                >a single cleaning movement is all you need…</a

            </li>
            <li>Once in and out. Done.</li>
            <li>Do this before or after cleaning your teeth in the evening.</li>
            <li>
              Ask your dental professional about the right interdental brush for
              you. It’s important to follow your dentist’s recommendation on
              which size interdental brushes to use. If a brush is too small for
              the space, it won’t do the job. If it’s too big, it won’t fit in
              and you could hurt your gums.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Clean your dental implants with a specially-designed toothbrush…
          </p>
          <p>
            The area below your implant is one of those that can be difficult to
            reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            If these areas are not properly cleaned, it can lead to serious
            dental problems.

          <h3>Can dental implants get infected?</h3>
          <p>
            It’s always important to take great care of your teeth and gums –
            and better oral health leads in turn to better overall health.
          </p>
          <p>But your dental implants need special attention.</p>
          <p>
            It’s crucial for you to carefully clean implant surfaces and the
            hard-to-reach areas around your implants.
          </p>
          <h3>Dental implant infection signs</h3>
          <p>
            Failure to do so can result in gum disease such as mucositis –
            swelling and redness around the gums caused by a build-up of
            bacteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the plaque is not removed, mucositis can lead to
            peri-implantitis – with the risk that your implant could become
            loose.
          </p>
