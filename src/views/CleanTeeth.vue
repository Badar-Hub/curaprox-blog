          <p>
            Why is keeping your teeth clean so important for your oral health,
            your overall health… and your confidence?
          </p>
          <p>
            Plaque is the thin, sticky film of bacteria that is constantly
            forming on our teeth.<br /><br />It’s the main cause of tooth decay,
            gum disease and other dental problems.<br /><br />Effectively
            fighting and removing plaque is the foundation for great oral health
            for life. If we fail to remove plaque, it hardens into tartar – a
            yellow or brown-coloured deposit. The only way to get rid of tartar
            is to visit the dental hygienist.<br /><br />But we can easily
            prevent it with a great oral health routine.

          <h4>SIX BRUSHING METHODS</h4>
          <h2>THE GOOD, THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY</h2>

          <img

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>How to clean your teeth for a healthy mouth</p>
          <p>
            Many dental problems are caused by brushing the wrong way.<br /><br />Putting
            this right can be a gamechanger.<br /><br />Let’s take a look at six
            brushing methods.<br /><br />Some of the methods are, unfortunately,
            all too common. Others are less well known.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the best way to clean teeth?</h3>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/70/cleen-teeth-best-toothbrush-cs5460-how-to-brush-800x480.jpg"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Methods one and two are both bad and ugly – many people are making
            these mistakes… and they’re causing many health problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile,
            learning and consistently using methods three to six give you the
            gentlest, most effective ways to enjoy clean teeth.<br /><br />And
            if you take a little time to learn and incorporate them into your
            daily routine…<br /><br />… you can change your oral health – and
            overall health – forever.
          </p>
          <h4>METHOD 1</h4>
          <h2>BRUSH TEETH QUICKLY</h2>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/70/cleen-teeth-hopp-800x480.jpg"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Why it's no good...</strong></p>
          <p>
            Brushing quickly will only remove plaque from the parts of your
            teeth that are easy to access.
          </p>
          <h3><br />How do you get plaque off your teeth?</h3>
          <p>
            If you don’t properly brush the backs of your teeth or the more
            difficult-to-reach areas – behind the molars and premolars, for
            example – plaque will continue to accumulate.
          </p>
          <h4>METHOD 2</h4>
          <h2>BRUSH TEETH HARD WITH A HARD BRUSH</h2>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/70/cleen-teeth-hard-bristles-800x480.jpg"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Why it’s no good…</strong></p>
          <p>
            Many reasons including:<br /><br />i) It damages the tooth enamel<br /><br />ii)
            It can lead to receding gums, which exposes the “neck” of the tooth
            that sits between the crown and the root. This, in turn, can lead to
            the pain of sensitive teeth… followed by decay, infection,
            gingivitis, periodontitis and eventually even tooth loss.<br /><br />iii)
            Hard bristles cannot properly clean the sulcus – the groove between
            the teeth and gums, which is a breeding ground for the bacteria that
            cause plaque
          </p>
          <p><strong>And now, the best brushing methods…</strong></p>
          <h4>METHOD 3</h4>
          <h2>A THOROUGH, GENTLE BRUSHING</h2>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/70/cleen-teeth-softer-bristles-800x480.jpg"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Why it’s so good…</strong></p>
          <p>
            It’s the best way to remove plaque and prevent it from building up.
          </p>
          <h3>How to brush your teeth properly step by step?</h3>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/70/cleen-teeth-angle-toothbrush-800x480.jpg"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Hold the brush like a pen – nice and gentle – and tilt at a 45
            degree angle…<br /><br />… with half the toothbrush filaments on
            your gums and half on your teeth.<br /><br />Moving in small, gentle
            circles – almost without any pressure…<br /><br />Start with the
            most difficult places – the inside of the teeth and the back molars,
            continue on the outside, finish with the chewing surfaces.<br /><br />Here

            With the right technique, the best manual toothbrushes clean just as

            boost the hydrodynamic effect: the mixture of saliva, water and
            toothpaste can destroy plaque on implants, between the teeth and
            under braces particularly well.”

          <p><strong>Why it’s so good…</strong></p>
          <p>
            You won’t be able to enjoy really clean teeth unless you use
            interdental brushes to brush in the interdental spaces – the spaces
            between your teeth.<br /><br />Many millions of people are still yet
            to join the interdental cleaning revolution…<br /><br />… even
            though failing to do so is a major health risk…<br /><br />… because
            the gaps between your teeth are the perfect breeding ground for
            dental plaque.<br /><br />Use
            <a href="https://curaprox.ch/en/shop/interdental"
              ><strong>CURAPROX CPS interdental brushes</strong></a
            >
            to gently clean your interdental spaces… before or after brushing
            your teeth every evening.<br /><br />A single cleaning movement is
            all you need: Once in and out. Done.<br /><br />Here’s
            <a

                >our ultimate guide to using CPS interdental brushes</strong
              ></a
            >.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Ask a dental professional to measure your
            interdental spaces to work out which size interdental brushes are
            right for you. Too small for the space and the brush won’t do the
            job. Too big and it won’t fit… and could hurt your gums.

            Take gumline cleaning – and cleaning hard-to-reach surfaces behind
            the molars – to the next level with

          </p>
          <h3><br />Solo technique teeth cleaning guide</h3>
          <p>
            Use a single tuft brush to make precise, gentle, “shaking” movements
            along the gumline – from one side of the tooth to the other.<br /><br />It
            takes a little practice.<br /><br />But dental professionals says
            it’s the perfect way to clean the gumline and behind the molars.

          <p>
            So now you know the best ways to keep your teeth and gums clean and
            healthy with a great oral health routine!<br /><br />But regular
            visits to a dentist and dental hygienist are also essential. Your
            hygienist will use special instruments to remove plaque and any
            tartar.<br /><br />And a good hygienist can coach you on how to find
            the best oral health care routine for your own specific needs.

          <h2><br /><br />MOUTHWASH AND DENTAL FLOSS</h2>
          <h3>Should I use mouthwash before or after brushing?</h3>
          <p>
            Most mouthwashes are not effective in penetrating dental plaque and
            their antiseptic properties can disrupt your natural oral
            microflora.<br /><br />In special cases, such as before or after
            invasive dental procedures,<a
              href="https://curaprox.ch/en/shop/oral-rinses-and-gels"

          </p>
          <h3><br />Should I use dental floss to keep my teeth clean?</h3>
          <p>
            According to a recent
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99431/"
              ><strong>meta-analysis</strong></a
            >, cleaning with interdental brushes is significantly more effective
            than flossing.<br /><br />But the front teeth, especially the lower
            ones, can be particularly close together.<br /><br />In these cases,
            using
            <a href="https://curaprox.ch/en/shop/interdental/dental-floss"
              ><strong>CURAPROX dental floss</strong></a
            >
            can be the best way to get into these interdental spaces to clean.
