            REPLACE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH REGULARLY
          </h2>
          <p>
            We’ll tell you how often you should replace this all-important
            bathroom item to make sure it doesn’t lead to unnecessary trouble
            for your mouth or overall health.
          </p>
          <p>
            A toothbrush is a dental hygiene instrument that should be used for
            approximately three months, but many of us neglect to follow this
            simple advice. There are two important reasons why a toothbrush
            should be replaced regularly: firstly, as a result of mechanical
            wear, the bristles start to bend, leading to insufficient removal of
            dental plaque over time. The second reason is the rapid accumulation
            of bacteria, which tends to grow much faster in moist environments.
          </p>
          <h4>STEP ONE</h4>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            It is important to rinse your toothbrush after every use under a
            stream of water and leave it to dry in the upright position.
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is not necessary to keep a cover on your toothbrush; these small
            plastic cases are only intended for protection during occasional
            transport. Keeping your brush covered all the time can lead to the
            growth of large amounts of surface bacteria on the cover itself. On
            top of that, a cover prevents the bristles inside from drying out
            properly, trapping moisture and creating the ideal environment for
            bacteria to thrive.
          </p>

          <h3>LEAVE YOUR BRUSH TO DRY IN UPRIGHT POSITION</h3>
          <h4>STEP TWO</h4>

            <img

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>You could be brushing your teeth too hard</h3>
          <p>
            You might think that toothbrushes designed with a larger number of
            bristles, like
            <a href="https://curaprox.ch/en/info/toothbrushes/cs-5460"
              >CURAPROX brushes</a
            >, would be likely to wear out even faster, but the truth is that
            even these ultrafine bristles are designed and tested to keep teeth
            healthy throughout three months of everyday use.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your toothbrush bristles are frayed and the fibres are bent after
            just a few days or weeks, you could be doing something wrong. A
            toothbrush that wears out too quickly is often the result of
            applying too much pressure, which is the consequence of using a
            wrong cleaning technique.
          </p>

            To be on the safe side, read the&nbsp;<a

            to prevent&nbsp;your toothbrush from wearing out too quickly or
            potentially even hurting your teeth and gums. You can also ask your
            dentist or dental hygienist about the proper use of a toothbrush.

            If you’ve been under the weather recently, it’s a good idea to
            replace your toothbrush – even if it still seems to be in good
            shape. In fact, your toothbrush should be replaced following the
            recovery from a viral or bacterial infection. Whether you’ve just
            been suffering from a common cold or another infectious disease,
            don’t hesitate – just get a new one.

            A WORN-OUT TOOTHBRUSH DOES NOT CLEAN YOUR TEETH AS EFFECTIVELY
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong
              >1. Replace your toothbrush approximately every three
              months</strong
            >&nbsp;to avoid bent bristles and the accumulation of bacteria.<br /><br /><strong
              >2. Don’t apply too much pressure.</strong
            >&nbsp;A toothbrush often wears out too quickly as the result of
            applying too much pressure or having a poor cleaning technique.<br /><br /><strong
              >3. Replace your toothbrush immediately after an illness.</strong
            >&nbsp;After a common cold or any other infectious disease, it’s a
            good idea to just get a new one. If you don’t, the illness might
            return, courtesy of your toothbrush.
