          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Care for your dental implants – and help prevent further implants –
            by committing to a great oral health routine…
          </p>

            >
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brush your teeth twice a day</li>
            <li>Use interdental brushes once a day</li>
            <li>Cut down on sugary food and drink</li>

          <h3>Use interdental brushes to clean your dental implants…</h3>
          <p>
            Failure to brush in the interdental spaces - the spaces between
            teeth - is a major health risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            And cleaning with interdental brushes is significantly more
            effective than flossing, according to a recent
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99431/"
              >meta-analysis</a

            HOW TO LOOK AFTER YOUR DENTAL IMPLANTS WITH INTERDENTAL BRUSHES…
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After implant treatment, the spaces around your “new tooth” can be
              much larger than usual.
            </li>
            <li>

              gently clean those spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              As with all CURAPROX interdental brushes,
              <a href="https://curaprox.ch/en/blog"
                >a single cleaning movement is all you need…</a

            </li>
            <li>Once in and out. Done.</li>
            <li>Do this before or after cleaning your teeth in the evening.</li>
            <li>
              Ask your dental professional about the right interdental brush for
              you. It’s important to follow your dentist’s recommendation on
              which size interdental brushes to use. If a brush is too small for
              the space, it won’t do the job. If it’s too big, it won’t fit in
              and you could hurt your gums.

            The area below your implant is one of those that can be difficult to
            reach.

          <h3>Can dental implants get infected?</h3>
          <p>
            It’s always important to take great care of your teeth and gums –
            and better oral health leads in turn to better overall health.
          </p>
          <p>But your dental implants need special attention.</p>
          <p>
            It’s crucial for you to carefully clean implant surfaces and the
            hard-to-reach areas around your implants.
          </p>
          <h3>Dental implant infection signs</h3>
          <p>
            Failure to do so can result in gum disease such as mucositis –
            swelling and redness around the gums caused by a build-up of
            bacteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the plaque is not removed, mucositis can lead to
            peri-implantitis – with the risk that your implant could become
            loose.
          </p>
          <h2>IMPLANTS PREPARATION AND RECOVERY</h2>
