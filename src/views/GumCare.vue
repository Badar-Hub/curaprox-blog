          <h2>CARING FOR YOUR GUMS</h2>
          <p><strong>You’ve come to the right place if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You sometimes feel your gums are swollen or sensitive – or you’ve
              noticed blood after brushing – and you want to deal with it. Or…
            </li>
            <li>
              You want to learn the best ways to care for your gums and prevent
              gum problems. (We’ve helped millions of people with their oral
              health – and trained tens of thousands of dentists worldwide in
              practising prevention.) Or…
            </li>
            <li>
              You worry your gums are receding and want to know if there’s
              anything you can do about it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>STEP ONE</h4>
          <h2>WHAT IS GUM DISEASE?</h2>

          <img
            class="sp-class-img" src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/65/curaprox-need-gumcare-disease-2-900x450-web.jpg"
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Learn about gum disease and the dangers of gingivitis and
            periodontitis...
          </p>
          <h3>Bleeding gums</h3>
          <p>
            Maybe you’ve noticed traces of red when biting into an apple. You’re
            not alone. Bleeding gums are very common.&nbsp;But you must treat it
            as a warning sign.<br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3>Gingivitis</h3>
          <p>
            It could mean you have an early stage of gum disease known as
            gingivitis (other symptoms can include dark red, soft, sensitive
            gums and bad breath). The main cause of gingivitis is a build-up of
            bacterial plaque.<br /><br /><strong
              >IMPORTANT: The good news is that, in many cases, you can deal
              with and prevent gingivitis by committing to a great oral health
              routine.</strong
            >
            (You’ve come to the right place. Please see the steps below!)<br /><br />As
            ever, it’s also important to make regular visits to your dentist and
            dental hygienist.
          </p>
          <h3>Periodontitis</h3>
          <p>
            When not treated, gingivitis can lead to periodontitis – an
            inflammation of the tissues that hold in place and support the
            teeth. If periodontitis is left untreated you risk losing a tooth.
            Please see your dental professional if you have any concerns.
          </p>
          <h4>STEP TWO</h4>
          <h2>BRUSH THE RIGHT WAY</h2>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/65/curaprox-need-gumcare-toothbrus-900x450-web.jpg"
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Use a gentle, effective toothbrush with the right technique to keep
            your gums healthy…
          </p>
          <p>
            Get your gum health right and you give yourself an incredible
            foundation for a healthy mouth. A great starting point is to
            understand the following…<br /><br />The idea that we should brush
            hard with a hard brush is simply not true. The sulcus – the groove
            between the teeth and gums – is a breeding ground for the bacteria
            that form plaque. But it’s very difficult to clean with a hard
            toothbrush – hard bristles simply can’t adapt to the structured
            surface of the sulcus.
          </p>
          <p>This can lead to two unfortunate scenarios.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The sulcus fills with bacteria and becomes infected.<br /><br />&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Because they find it hard to clean the sulcus with their hard
              toothbrush… many people scrub the area all around the sulcus using
              lots and lots of pressure. In this case, it’s possible to achieve
              a clean, healthy sulcus… while at the same time destroying your
              gums.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Receding gums</h3>
          <p>
            Both scenarios can lead to receding gums.<br /><br />This exposes
            the “neck” of the tooth that sits between the crown and the root,
            which can lead to the pain of sensitive teeth… followed by decay,
            infection, gingivitis, periodontitis and eventually even tooth
            loss.<br /><br />Please see your dentist if you have receding
            gums.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can avoid further recession by
            learning to brush the right way.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3>‘Gums love this toothbrush’</h3>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/65/CS5460_072s.jpg"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Gums are soft and need to be cleaned gently. Which is why dental
            professionals recommend gentle, fine filaments – and lots of
            them!<br /><br />The stylish<a
              href="https://curaprox.ch/en/shop/toothbrushes/manual-toothbrushes/cs-5460"
            >
              Curaprox CS 5460 toothbrush</a
            >
            is so called because it features 5,460 fine and gentle CUREN®
            filaments (instead of conventional nylon) – each 0.1mm in
            diameter.&nbsp;This is a super-dense, cleaning surface like no
            other. The&nbsp;CS 5460 is therefore exceptionally effective and
            ensures no damage to the gums.&nbsp;The CS 5460’s many fine
            filaments gently and effectively clean the entire sulcus – without
            causing any injury.<br /><br />That’s why dentists, dental
            hygienists and customers all recommend it. It’s also why we proudly
            boast that “gums love this toothbrush”.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

            Just as important as using a gentle toothbrush: brushing your teeth
            and gumline with just the right amount of pressure.<br /><br /><a

            you to deal with – or ward off – gingivitis and the risk of
            periodontitis.<br /><br />Interdental spaces – the tiny spaces
            between teeth – are the perfect places for plaque to hide and grow
            and infect your gums…<br /><br />… often undisturbed because

            may well notice some bleeding. This indicates inflammation.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3>How to get healthy gums again</h3>
          <p>
            Don’t worry. Continue caring for your gums with this routine every
            single day, before or after brushing your teeth in the evening.
            After a week, the inflammation and any bleeding should subside.
            (Please seek advice from your dentist if not.)<br /><br />Please
            also see a dental professional to find out which sizes of
            interdental brush are right for you. If it’s too small it won’t
            clean properly. If it’s too big it won’t fit in and could hurt your
            gums.<br /><br />&nbsp;

            Making the precise, gentle movements along the gumline – almost
            without any pressure – takes a little practice. But, once perfected,
            it’s considered by dental professionals to be the perfect way to

            molars.

            – designed so the brush tuft head perfectly matches the gum line –
            while reading a good book or watching a movie.<br /><br />Dr
            Sedelmayer, who passed away in July 2019, was the founder of the
            individually trained oral prophylaxis (iTOP) programme, teaching
            students and dental professionals the correct criteria – and a
            hands-on approach – for disease prevention. His influence in
            dentistry cannot be overstated.<br /><br />&nbsp;

          <p>Why is gum care so important for your overall health?</p>
          <p>
            There is no question taking care of your teeth and gums leads to
            better overall health.<br /><br />If bacterial toxins in the mouth
            enter the bloodstream though inflamed gums, you could be putting
            your heart, brain, lungs and immune system in danger.<br /><br />Dentist
            and Curaprox Head of Professional Education Ana Stevanović says the
            connection between gum health and overall health is “a two-way
            street”.<br /><br />“The mouth is connected with the rest of our
            body, and it is time for us to start observing the full picture,”
            she says.<br /><br />“There is no oral health and overall health;
            there is health, period. Good oral health habits, based on
            mechanical plaque control, can improve the health of the rest of our
            body.”
