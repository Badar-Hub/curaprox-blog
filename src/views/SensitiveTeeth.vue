          <h3>What does tooth sensitivity mean?</h3>
          <p>
            Do you feel a short, stabbing pain or longer-term discomfort when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Eating or drinking hot or cold food or drink?</li>
            <li>Consuming sweet or acidic food or drink?</li>
            <li>Brushing your teeth?</li>
            <li>Or just breathing in cold air?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It’s an unpleasant sensation and it can start to get you down.<br /><br />Fortunately,
            sufferers can often deal with the problem by consistently following
            a series of simple steps. Keep reading!<br /><br />(Please contact a
            dental professional with serious problems or if your symptoms do not
            improve.)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

          <h3>What causes sensitive teeth?</h3>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/61/need-sensitivity-grafik-lupe-576x540.png"

          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Tooth enamel protects dentine – the softer tissue found beneath
            it.<br /><br />If the enamel is damaged or starts to thin, it
            exposes the dentine, which can lead to pain and sensitivity.<br /><br />There
            are a number of causes for the loss of tooth enamel including
            brushing too hard, tooth grinding and acid erosion (see below).<br /><br />Receding
            gums expose the root surfaces of the teeth (the “tooth necks”),
            which are not protected by enamel, and can also cause tooth
            sensitivity.<br /><br />And teeth whitening patients often
            experience sensitivity after treatment.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3>How to prevent acid erosion on teeth</h3>

          <img
            src="https://curaprox.ch/modules/advancedcms/uploads/AdvancedCmsBlockTeaser/61/need-sensitivity-grafik-food-576x540.png"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            You should take special care with acidic food and drink such as cola
            and other soft drinks, energy drinks, fruit and fruit juices…<br /><br />…
            because the acidity attacks the structure of your tooth enamel.<br /><br />So
            too much exposure to these foods and drinks can damage the
            enamel.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3>To help combat this:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Enjoy drinks like orange juice or cola as a treat only</li>
            <li>Take a sip of water after consuming acidic food or drink</li>
            <li>
              Don’t brush your teeth straight after acidic food or drink – the
              enamel will be weakened and susceptible to damage… so wait at
              least half an hour
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>STEP TWO</h4>
          <h2>SENSITIVE TEETH TOOTHPASTE</h2>

            Choose the right sensitive teeth toothpaste to tackle and ward off
            sensitive teeth pain…
          </h3>
          <p>
            Choosing the right toothpaste is crucial – as are brushing the right
            way with a gentle, effective toothbrush… and being careful about
            what you eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a low-RDA toothpaste with Hydroxylapatite – such as&nbsp;<a

            – strengthens enamel…

          <h3>What is best for sensitive teeth? Hydroxylapatite</h3>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Laboratory tests have now shown that, with regular brushing,
            Hydroxylapatite – a rare but naturally occurring mineral – creates a
            sealant for sensitive teeth…<br /><br />… which also gives your
            teeth a beautiful, smooth glow.
          </p>

            <li>Remineralise and recalcify damaged tooth enamel</li>
            <li>Heal tiny defects on the surface of the tooth</li>
            <li>Reduce the sensitivity of exposed root surfaces</li>
            <li>
              Close openings that expose dentine – stopping some of the painful
              stimuli from reaching the nerve
            </li>
            <li>
              Reach deep into the layers of the tooth to combat tooth decay<br /><br />&nbsp;

          </ul>
          <h3>
            Use a low RDA sensitive teeth toothpaste… and beware of strong
            whitening toothpastes

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The higher the Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) score of a
            toothpaste, the more abrasive it is…<br /><br />… and the more
            likely it is to erode the enamel on your teeth because of harsh,
            abrasive ingredients such as sodium metaphosphate, zirconium
            silicate and calcium pyrophosphate.<br /><br />Similarly, strong
            whitening toothpastes with harsh ingredients can lead to enhanced

            Use the best toothbrushes for sensitive teeth with the best
            technique – together with interdental brushes…
          </p>
          <p>
            Brushing vigorously with a hard toothbrush can lead to all sorts of
            problems.<br /><br />Dental hygiene practice owner Edith Maurer
            Bussink says many people cause “a lot of damage by brushing too much
            with a hard toothbrush using excessive pressure”.<br /><br />“If too
            much pressure is always used, particularly with a medium hard or
            even hard toothbrush, it has an abrasive effect on the teeth over
            time,” she says. “The gums also recede and the necks of the teeth
            are exposed.”<br /><br />Brushing in this way erodes the teeth
            enamel and can lead to teeth sensitivity.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h4>
            EDITH MAURER’S GUIDE TO THE BEST WAY TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH &amp; GUMS
          </h4>
          <p>
            Brushing your teeth and gums twice a day in the following way can
            help you to deal with and prevent teeth sensitivity…<br /><br />“Position
            the brush correctly: half of the bristles on the teeth, the other
            half on the gum,” Edith Maurer says.<br /><br />“The brush is held
            at a slight angle so that the bristles point towards the gumline.
            You now brush in small circles, using as little pressure as
            possible.”<br /><br />She adds that it’s crucial to use “a
            particularly soft brush with very fine bristles” – such as the
            <a
              href="https://curaprox.ch/en/shop/toothbrushes/manual-toothbrushes/cs-5460"
              >Curaprox CS 5460 toothbrush.</a
            ><br /><br />“Fine bristles penetrate the gumline easily,” she adds.
            “And particularly soft to avoid damaging the gumline.”<br /><br />All
            Curaprox toothbrushes, both manual and sonic, use fine and gentle
            CUREN® filaments – instead of conventional nylon.<br /><br />&nbsp;

          <h3>Sonic toothbrush for sensitive teeth</h3>
          <p>
            For those who prefer them, sonic toothbrushes “make brushing that
            bit easier”, Edith Maurer says.<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a

            was designed by Prof. Dr. med. dent. Ueli P. Saxer.<br /><br />It
            features a sensitive head for careful tooth cleaning and oscillates
            with up to 42,000 sonic waves per minute.<br /><br />Edith Maurer
            adds: “This is so fast that the mixture of saliva, water and
            toothpaste is literally swirled around in the mouth. This mixture
            gets to the plaque between the teeth - and at high speed. The plaque
            is simply cleaned away, even in those hard to reach areas.”<br /><br />&nbsp;

          />

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Edith Maurer also recommends the “solo technique” – cleaning the gum
            line around each individual tooth with precise movements using
            the&nbsp;<a
              href="https://curaprox.ch/en/shop/toothbrushes/single-tuft-toothbrushes/cs-1006"
              >CURAPROX CS 1006</a
            >
            single-tuft brush.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this method the solo brush is the ultimate way to clean – and
            avoid inflammation – in the gum line.
          </p>
          <p>In turn, you can avoid:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The formation of biofilm – or plaque – in the gum line…</li>
            <li>… thus avoiding further inflammation…</li>
            <li>… thus avoiding receding gums…</li>
            <li>… thus avoiding exposed tooth necks!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That is a whole lot of sensitive teeth pain avoided!<br /><br />This
            technique is also perfect for taking care of your oral health if you
            suffer from receding gums and exposed teeth roots.

            can prevent receding gums and the sensitivity caused when the necks
            of the teeth are exposed.<br /><br />“It’s best to have your dentist
            or dental hygienist show you how to do this properly,” says Edith
            Maurer. “This will also ensure that you use the correct size of the
            interdental brush. If they are too small, they won’t clean well and
            if they are too big, they can cause damage.”
