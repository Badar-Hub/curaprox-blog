            The challenge of taking care of your braces and your oral health…
          </h3>
          <p>
            Congratulations on making the commitment to orthodontic
            treatment!<br /><br />Before you know it, you’ll be enjoying the new
            confidence of straight teeth.<br /><br />But with this commitment
            comes responsibility.<br /><br />Because the only way to remove the
            plaque is by using a toothbrush and interdental brushes. But that
            becomes more difficult for brace wearers –whether that’s fixed
            braces or removable aligners. That’s because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Plaque builds up in the tiny gaps and hard-to-reach spots between
              the braces and the teeth <i>and</i>
            </li>
            <li>Tiny bits of food get stuck in braces, brackets and wires</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Which, if you don’t know what you’re doing is a worry…<br /><br />…
            because plaque is the main cause of tooth decay, gum disease and
            other dental problems.
          </p>
          <h3>Caring for your braces and your oral health&nbsp;</h3>

            any damage.<br /><br />And with the unique “bracket groove” on the

            perfectly wrap around braces and clasps… and clean more
            effectively.<br /><br />The octagonal handle, meanwhile, makes it
            very difficult NOT to brush your teeth at the correct angle…<br /><br />…

          <h3>How many times a day should you brush your teeth with braces?</h3>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Brush twice a day with the right technique:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Position the
              <a

                ><strong>CURAPROX CS 5460 ortho</strong></a
              >&nbsp;at an angle of about 45 degrees on the gumline
            </li>
            <li>Avoid horizontal brushing movements</li>
            <li>
              Move along your teeth and braces with tiny, gentle circular
              movements
            </li>
            <li>Take care to clean the gumline as well</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The key to effectively removing plaque
            and enjoying healthy teeth and gums is gentle brushing. Many people
            brush too hard, which causes problems including damaged tooth
            enamel, receding gums and exposed tooth roots.

            before or after brushing every evening.<br /><br />Don’t forget, if
            you have wire retainers fitted behind your teeth… flossing is
            impossible! Interdental brushes are the ONLY way to clean between
            the teeth.<br /><br />Please ask your dentist to find the right
            sized interdental brushes for you. If they’re too small for the
            space – the brush won’t do the job. Too big and they won’t fit and
            could hurt your gums.
